# HELL
Hedude's Effective Learning Language

HELL is a language that describes learning in a way that expert rules can be understand without errors by AI.

Education designers or researchers can formulate their ideas or findings in a way that can be implemented in programs.

HELL (the educational language) is designed to promote free learning, adhering strictly to scientifically substantiated reasons for any form of imposition. Therefore, it doesn't arbitrarily structure learning units unless strictly necessary. For instance, the ordering of sub-units within a unit is only justified if it's crucial for the learning process. This is primarily the case when certain skills can only be acquired after mastering prerequisite skills, ensuring a logical and necessary progression in the learning journey.
