# Free learning language

**Freell** is a language that describes learning in a way that expert rules can be understand without errors by AI.

Education designers or researchers can **for real** formulate their ideas or findings in a way that can be implemented in programs.

**Freell**  is designed to promote free learning, adhering strictly to scientifically substantiated reasons for any form of imposition.
Therefore, it doesn't arbitrarily structure learning units unless strictly necessary. 
For instance, the ordering of sub-units within a unit is only justified if it's crucial for the learning process.
This is primarily the case when certain skills can only be acquired after mastering prerequisite skills, ensuring a logical and necessary progression in the learning journey.

## Testing

The validation of **Freell** hinges on three pivotal axes: Turing Completeness, conversion to recognized educational standards, and practical applicability in open ELOs like Moodle.

### Turing Completeness:

A formal proof will be conducted to ascertain Turing completeness, 
establishing Freell's capability to encapsulate complex computational logic akin to a Turing machine.

### Standard Conversion:

A set of conversion modules will be developed to translate Freell syntax into the formats 
prescribed by the Experience API (xAPI), cmi5 specification, 
and Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM).
The accuracy and integrity of the conversion process will be rigorously verified 
against predefined benchmarks.

### Practical Applicability and Acceptance Testing:

Freell will be employed to design courses within open ELO environments like Moodle. 
User acceptance tests will gauge the satisfaction and efficacy from an end-user perspective. 
Concurrently, the correct prompting utilization by AI will be assessed 
through a series of specified tests, ensuring an accurate reflection of the Freell syntax 
in promoting learning objectives.

### AI Interaction Testing:

The interaction between Freell and AI's will be thoroughly examined 
to ensure that learning prompting is accurately executed, 
thereby validating Freell’s practicality in real-world educational settings.

This multi-faceted testing approach aims to furnish a comprehensive validation framework, 
ensuring that Freell not only adheres to theoretical computational principles 
but also seamlessly integrates with existing educational standards and platforms, 
fostering a conducive and effective learning environment.
