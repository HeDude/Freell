Freell Language - Specification Rule for Learner Freedom in Education Architecture

Specification Rule for Learner Freedom:

- Mandatory Declaration: 
  In every 'education architecture' construct, the first statement after the initial declaration 
  must specify the main object type, which defines the learner's freedom.

- Correct Format:
  The root is a/an [Object Type] called [Name].

- Example:
  The root is an actor called Teacher.

Object Types in Education Architecture:

1. Actor:
   - Description: Represents scenarios where an "Education Architect" designs the learning experience, 
     reducing the learner's freedom. Necessary when a third party, like a teacher or educational designer, 
     influences the learning process.

2. Portfolio:
   - Description: Implies an expectation for the learner to showcase their learning. Demands validation from 
     an external party but allows the learner to explore freely.

3. Action:
   - Description: Focuses on result-oriented education. The learner must demonstrate concrete actions or 
     behaviors to show learning outcomes.

4. Unit:
   - Description: Involves the division of the learning process into units by an educational designer. 
     This structure can limit the learner's freedom, as it often doesn't align with the learner's natural 
     development pace.

5. Prerequisite:
   - Description: Requires learners to possess certain starting skills or characteristics to participate. 
     Typically relates to skills acquired in previous units.

6. Resource:
   - Description: Serves as a suggestion or aid that learners can consult. The use of a "Resource" is not 
     prescriptive, allowing for a degree of freedom in how learning occurs.

7. Method:
   - Description: The final type before learning is no longer considered free. Involves specific methodologies 
     that the learner is expected to follow. Freell tailors strategies to suit different learning styles, such as:
     - Entrepreneurial Learning: For productive learning styles.
     - Investigative Learning: For meaning-oriented learning styles.
     - Design Learning: For application-oriented learning styles.
     - Model Learning: For reproductive learning styles.
