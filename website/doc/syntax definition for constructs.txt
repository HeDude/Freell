Freell Language - Syntax Definition for Constructs

In Freell, every construct, representing a comprehensive design for a specific type of free learning block, 
must adhere to a standardized declaration format. This format is crucial for the language to recognize and 
categorize the construct appropriately.

General Declaration Rule for Constructs:

- Format: 
  Each construct must be declared with the first statement in the format:
  This [Construct Type] is called [Name].

- Construct Types:
  The [Construct Type] can be one of the following, based on the purpose of the construct:
  - expert rule: For constructs focusing on specialized rules or guidelines in the learning process.
  - education architecture: For designs that outline the structure and strategy of educational systems or programs.
  - learning portfolio: For documenting the learning journey, experiences, and accomplishments of free learners.

- Name Specification:
  The [Name] in the declaration must be unique within the context it's used. It identifies the specific 
  construct being defined.

Example Declarations:

1. Expert Rule:
   This expert rule is called Innovative Teaching Techniques.

2. Education Architecture:
   This education architecture is called Interactive Curriculum Design.

3. Learning Portfolio:
   This learning portfolio is called John's Learning Journey.

Purpose and Utilization:

- This declaration syntax is mandatory for the Freell language to understand the context and category of the construct.
- It ensures clarity and consistency in the way different types of learning blocks are defined and processed.

Note:

- This structured approach to defining constructs in Freell aligns with its design philosophy, emphasizing clarity, 
  specificity, and ease of understanding for both humans and AI systems like myself.
- It facilitates efficient parsing and interpretation of different educational constructs within the Freell programming environment.
