# Introduction
Freell stands for Free Learning Language and aims to provide the maximum freedom in the learning process. This wiki explores the various types in which Freell categorizes the learning experience, from the most free to the most structured.

# Types
The level of freedom determines the need for certain types to be used in Freell.
## None
The ultimate freedom in learning is when the learner designs their own learning experience.
In Freell, we call this individual a "Learning Architect."

## Actor
When a third party starts to design the learning experience, like a teacher or an educational designer, the learner’s freedom is reduced. We refer to this external influencer as an "Education Architect." The type **Actor** is needed.

## Portfolio
When there is an expectation for the learner to showcase what they have learned, we enter the realm of **Portfolio**." This type demands validation from an external party but still allows the learner to explore freely.

## Action
As we move toward result-oriented education, Freell identifies **Action** as the next level. In this type, the learner must demonstrate concrete actions or behaviors to show that learning (getting certain skills, learning goals, competences, attitudes, knowledge ectera) has occurred.

## Prerequiaite
Often a educational organisation will demands certain starting characteristics of the learner to allow him or her to participate. Mostly about the skills the learner already has.

## Method
The final type before we can no longer term the learning as free is "Method." This comes into play when there are specific methodologies that the learner is expected to follow. Of course Freell will use strategies as well, but will tailor it to the learner in this way for example
* _Entrepreneurial Learning_: Suited for the productive learning style.
* _Investigative Learning_: Suited for the meaning-oriented learning style.
* _Design Learning_: Suited for the application-oriented learning style.
* _Model Learning_: Suited for the reproductive learning style.

# Conclusion
Freell aims to categorize the learning experience based on the level of freedom afforded to the learner. From designing one's own learning journey to following specific methods, Freell seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of how freedom in learning is structured.
