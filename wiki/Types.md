# Introduction
Freell stands for Free Learning Language and aims to provide the maximum freedom in the learning process.
This wiki explores the various types in which Freell categorizes the learning experience,
from the most free to the most structured.
An education design starts with choosing the type of the root object
to which the learning branches and the learning leaves are connected.
This choice is forced upon an education designer 
to invite thinking carefully about the amount of freedom which is granted to the learner.

# Types
The level of freedom determines the type of the root object to be used in Freell.
This does not mean that the less free types can not be used as part of that root object.
It tells Freell mainly how to interpret the branches and leaves based on the type of the root object.
For example, if one uses Portfolio as the type of the root object and uses for example a Resource
as a child object, Freell will interpret this Resource in the light of the choice for a
education design in which the learner just learns and afterwards reports his learning
in this case by mentioning the resources it has used.
While if Resource was the type of the root object,
Freell will see the resource as a model, hint or example for the learner.

## None
The ultimate freedom in learning is when the learner designs their own learning experience.
In Freell, we call this individual a "Learning Architect."

## Actor
When a third party starts to design the learning experience, like a teacher or an educational designer, the learner’s freedom is reduced. We refer to this external influencer as an "Education Architect." The type **Actor** is needed.

## Portfolio
When there is an expectation for the learner to showcase what they have learned, we enter the realm of **Portfolio**." This type demands validation from an external party but still allows the learner to explore freely.

## Action
As we move toward result-oriented education, Freell identifies **Action** as the next level. In this type, the learner must demonstrate concrete actions or behaviors to show that learning (getting certain skills, learning goals, competences, attitudes, knowledge ectera) has occurred.

## Unit
If the educational designer organizes and/or divides the learning proces into units,
this further limits the freedom of the learner. Education knows schoolyears or courses for example to
divide the learning proces in time units or certain learning goals.
This division is seldom naturally or suited to the learner's free development.

## Prerequisite
Often a educational organisation will demands certain starting characteristics of the learner
to allow him or her to participate in a certain unit.
Mostly about the skills the learner already has (the previous units).

## Resource
In the context of free learning,
the "Resource" type serves as a suggestion, aid, or hint
that learners can consult for support
or as an example or model for structuring their learning process.
Importantly, the use of a "Resource" is not prescriptive;
it doesn't dictate "how" one must learn,
preserving the philosophy of free learning.
However, the choices made by the education architect in selecting
which resources to include or omit
can indeed influence the learning process and potentially make it less free.
This is particularly true for learners who are naturally more inclined
to follow guidance or established paths.

## Method
The final type before we can no longer term the learning as free is "Method." This comes into play when there are specific methodologies that the learner is expected to follow. Of course Freell will use strategies as well, but will tailor it to the learner in this way for example
* _Entrepreneurial Learning_: Suited for the productive learning style.
* _Investigative Learning_: Suited for the meaning-oriented learning style.
* _Design Learning_: Suited for the application-oriented learning style.
* _Model Learning_: Suited for the reproductive learning style.

# Conclusion
Freell aims to categorize the learning experience based on the level of freedom afforded to the learner. From designing one's own learning journey to following specific methods, Freell seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of how freedom in learning is structured.
