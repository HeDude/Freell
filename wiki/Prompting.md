# A Prompt-like Programming Language for Learning Architecture

## Why Prompt-like Syntax?

### 1. Simplicity and Abstraction

Freell aims to keep the language declarative, abstracting away most of the complexity. This ensures that the user only needs to focus on what they want to achieve, not how to achieve it. 

### 2. Clarity and Unambiguity

One of the challenges in educational design is the ambiguity often present in educational language. A well-defined, strict language eliminates this problem, making it easier to understand and implement educational designs without misunderstandings.

### 3. AI-Friendly

The prompt-like syntax is not just human-readable but also easily interpretable by AI. This makes it easier to incorporate AI assistance in the design process, as the AI can understand, learn, and even correct the design statements.

### 4. User Experience

The prompt-like interaction makes the user experience intuitive. It's designed to be so straightforward that both education experts and AI can understand it, making the design process more efficient.

## How Does It Work?

When interacted with, Freell starts by prompting the user with a statement like "Provide a name for the education architecture." This approach makes it self-explanatory, guiding the user through the design process.

## Future Direction

The aim is to further integrate AI to not just understand but also to learn Freell language through transfer learning. This will allow the AI to be more proactive in assisting with the design, improving efficiency and user experience.
