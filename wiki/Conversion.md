# Conversion
A way to use Freell is by automating the conversion of Descriptions of Learning Architectures to Freell Statements

## Introduction

A powerful feature we envision for Freell is the ability to automatically convert existing educational designs into Freell statements. This conversion process would be facilitated by an AI, which would interpret the provided educational description and translate it into Freell language.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user provides an existing educational design. This could be in the form of a document, like "Advanced Data Analysis," or any other textual description.

2. **AI Interpretation**: The AI scans the document and tries to abstract key components, aiming to translate them into Freell statements.

3. **AI-Freell Interaction**: The AI initiates a "conversation" with Freell, submitting the abstracted statements for validation or further guidance.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Freell reviews each statement, providing feedback or corrections as necessary. The AI uses this feedback to refine its understanding and generate more accurate Freell statements.

5. **Completion**: This iterative process continues until the AI has successfully translated the entire educational design into valid Freell statements.

## Advantages

- **Efficiency**: This automates the tedious process of manual translation, saving time and effort.
  
- **Accuracy**: The iterative feedback loop with Freell ensures that the final output adheres strictly to the language's syntax and semantics, minimizing errors.

- **User-Friendly**: This feature makes it easier for people who are not familiar with Freell to use it, as they can start with a format they are comfortable with.

- **AI Learning**: This process serves as a form of "training" for the AI, enabling it to improve its understanding of both educational designs and the Freell language.
