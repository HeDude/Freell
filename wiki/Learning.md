Freell leverages existing Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating human language into Freell. These models, already proficient in a variety of languages, are not taught by us but utilized for their advanced capabilities. However, Freell adds an extra layer to this process:

- **Freell's Interpreter:** Unlike traditional LLMs, Freell includes an interpreter that can identify and flag language errors. This ensures that translations by the LLM into Freell must be accurate and reliable. 

- **Integration with LLMs:** Freell harnesses the power of pre-existing LLMs due to their efficiency in language processing. These models are already trained in multiple languages, making them highly effective for Freell's purposes.

- **Adding an Extra Agent:** In addition to using standard LLMs, Freell introduces an additional agent, akin to LLMs but with specialized training. This agent learns the Freell language, augmenting the capabilities of the system and corrected by the interpreter.

- **Action Determination:** While the learning process for the standard language model remains as it is, such as learning a language, the determination of the action associated with a particular Freell instruction becomes more defined over time in the terms of expert rules. This approach ensures that the actions align more closely with the intended instructions in Freell. The goal is that all actions are expert rule based. 

The overall objective of Freell is not to retrain AI in language conversion but to effectively utilize and enhance existing models. This strategy balances the robustness of LLMs with the precision of rule-based action determination, making Freell a unique and efficient tool in language translation and action specification.

In practice, Freell's integration with AI and its interpreter functions through a dual mechanism:

- **Interpreter Feedback Loop with AI:** Freell's interpreter plays a crucial role in the language translation process. When the AI translates human language into Freell, the interpreter assesses the translation. If inaccuracies or errors are detected, this feedback is relayed back to the learning AI. This process occurs on large datasets, allowing the AI to continuously improve its accuracy in translating human language into Freell. This iterative process ensures that the translations become more precise over time, benefiting from the expansive learning capabilities of the AI.

- **Action Specification Through Expert Rules:** On the other hand, when a communication translated into Freell results in an action that is deemed effective or appropriate by the user or developer, this specific action is encoded as a hard-coded expert rule within Freell. This ensures that successful actions are consistently replicated in similar future scenarios. The addition of these expert rules contributes to a growing database of predefined, reliable actions, reducing the reliance on AI's interpretative capabilities for each instance.

- **Freell as a Prompting Language:** The design of Freell is such that it serves as an unambiguous prompting language for the AI. This clarity is essential because it ensures that the instructions received and processed by the AI are unequivocal and straightforward. The goal is to make Freell a "perfect" prompting language, minimizing misunderstandings or misinterpretations in the AI's processing of human instructions. The more clear and distinct Freell's structure is, the more effectively it can serve as a bridge between human language and AI-driven actions.

This practical approach in Freell's design and operation allows for a harmonious blend of AI's learning capabilities with rule-based action determination. It ensures that while the AI continues to learn and improve its language translation skills, the system also becomes more efficient and reliable in action specification through the incorporation of expert rules.
