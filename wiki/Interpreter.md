# Interpreter

## Interactive
Based on the objectives of clarity, developability, and testability,
the decision has been made to build an interpreter for Freell.
This interpreter will not only translate the declarative Freell language into actionable outputs
but also provide insightful explanations to the user on how translations are done.
This interactive feature aims to engage users in understanding and learning about free learning architectures.

## Csharp
Considering the future integration with learngame development in Unity,
C# has been chosen as the programming language for building the interpreter.
Among the available tools,
the Irony .NET Compiler Construction Kit stands out for its simplicity
and suitability for this project.

## Modulair
Irony will aid in defining the grammar of Freell
and constructing an interpreter in a modular structure.

This modular structure is pivotal for ensuring that different parts of the codebase can be developed, 
tested, and updated independently.

## TDD
A Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach will be employed
to ensure robustness and correctness of the interpreter from the outset.
Example dialogues and education architectures will serve as starting points for developing test cases.
These tests will guide the development process,
ensuring that the interpreter not only meets its functional requirements
but also serves as a learning tool for users exploring the realms of free learning architectures.

## Conclusion
With this structure, the Freell project endeavors to provide a clear, developable, and testable platform
that not only meets its technical goals
but also fosters an environment of learning and exploration for its users.
