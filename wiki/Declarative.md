## Brevity
In the endeavor of developing a proprietary language for learning processes,
the benefits of declarative programming have been underscored.
A notable advantage of this paradigm is the brevity it brings to code, 
provided the [interpreter](https://github.com/HeDude/Freell/wiki/Interpreter) or engine is adept at optimally interpreting the declarations.
This brevity is particularly beneficial when crafting a domain-specific language (DSL),
offering a more intuitive, readable articulation of domain logic.

Conversely, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often entails intricate relationships and interactions among objects,
which if not meticulously managed, can spiral into spaghetti codeâ€”a tangled, hard-to-follow, and maintain codebase.
This complexity in OOP emanates from the inherent mutability and extensive inter-object relationships, 
posing a risk of obfuscating code structure and logic, 
thereby making maintenance a challenging endeavor.

## Resultoriented
Given the mission of Freell (Free Learning Language),
the adoption of declarative programming is a harmonious fit.
It embodies simplicity, eliminating unnecessary frills
and enabling users to describe learning with ease.
This straightforward approach empowers users
to focus on articulating what they wish to achieve in terms of learning,
leaving the how to the interpreter.

## Effectiveness
The intelligent interpreter of Freell then translates these declarations into tangible outputs
such as learngame building blocks, xAPI storage, Moodle courses, API responses, etc., 
with an underlying emphasis on facilitating free learning.
This process encapsulates the effectiveness of learning,
embedding as much of it as possible within the system,
thereby alleviating the users from the burden of overthinking the technical intricacies.
The end goal is to streamline the learning design process,
making it intuitive, effective, and user-centric,
aligning perfectly with the ethos of free, unencumbered learning that Freell aspires to promote.

## Compiler
Indeed, while the Freell language is designed to be declarative for user simplicity and focus on the learning objectives,
the underlying interpreter that translates Freell's declarations
into actionable outputs benefits from an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture.
This OOP foundation in the interpreter allows for a structured, organized approach
to handling the diverse and potentially complex translations into various outputs
like game elements, xAPI storage, Moodle courses, or API responses.
The encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism principles of OOP provide a robust framework
to manage, extend, and interact with the different translation modules efficiently.
This object-oriented nature of the interpreter ensures that while users enjoy a straightforward, declarative interface,
the engine that powers Freell's translations is well-organized, extensible, and capable of handling the intricacies
involved in mapping learning declarations to a multitude of educational and interactive outputs.
