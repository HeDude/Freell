In Freell the approach to maintaining and substantiating a learning portfolio is distinct from traditional methods. In this system, the learner is not required to personally maintain or substantiate their portfolio. Instead, this task is undertaken by AI technologies through the process of learning analytics. The AI functions much like a 'bookkeeper' and 'advocate' for the learner's portfolio. It stores information about the learning process, analyzes it, and uses this analysis to validate that certain actions have been undertaken, thereby demonstrating specific competencies.

The key distinction in Freell is that the responsibility of portfolio maintenance and substantiation is shifted from the learner to the AI. This approach can be seen as an educational goal in itself, emphasizing the integration of AI in learning processes. However, it's important to note that if external parties explicitly require learners to maintain and substantiate their portfolios, the system then aligns more with an educational architecture rather than a learning architecture. This shift implies a more traditional approach where the learner is directly involved in the portfolio management process.
