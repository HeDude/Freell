## Conversion and Analysis of Existing Designs

Freell can analyze existing educational designs for their degree of freedom. This can be achieved by converting these designs into Freell code and then examining which elements can be omitted or are transformed into suggestions without reducing effectiveness. This would serve as a powerful tool for educational innovators.

## Turing Completeness in its Domain

Freell is only "Turing complete" within the specific domain of "free learning". This implies that the language can describe any conceivable education model that qualifies as "free learning". Freell is not able to describe or model all learning processes or systems. It can however always transform all those models into a free learning variant.

## Expert Rules

Freell's response in prompting language has the same syntax as for "expert rules". This is a way to integrate the language into decision-making systems that rely on expert knowledge.

## Learning Architecture and AI

The use of AI to "get to know" the learner and offer suggestions based on Freell directives paves the way for personalized learning on a scale that is currently unfeasible.

## Training for Education Architects

Freell serves also as a training tool for aspiring education architects. By learning the language, they are also being trained in the principles of effective and free educational design.
